# Della Beat Case Study using SQL
# Two main objectives are to identify customer needs by analysing the usage pattern and to boost product sales even if it means to introduce new product based on the customer's engagament. 
# If we are able to gather data of customer's usage from using non-BellaBeat product, we may land onto what could be the next product to be launched and at the same time, improving the existing products to bridge the gap.
